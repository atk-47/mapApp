# Onetap solution
This application was created as a part of hereMaps hackathon.

### Objective ###
We aim to provide user with all available location of a particular kind, such as restaurants,
hostpitals, fuel stations etc. We provide the user with a bunch of the target locations which are reacheable
within an user specified time.

### Technologies ###
We used 'python flask' for the backend.
And 'React.js' for the front-end and using the hereMaps APIs.
